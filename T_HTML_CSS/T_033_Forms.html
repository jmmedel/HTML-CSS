<!-- 
    The <form> Element
The HTML <form> element defines a form that is used to collect user input:
-->
<!-- 
    An HTML form contains form elements.

Form elements are different types of input elements, like
text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, and more.
-->
<!-- 
    The <input> Element
The <input> element is the most important form element.

The <input> element can be displayed in several ways, depending on the type attribute.

Here are some examples:
-->
<!-- 
    Type	Description
<input type="text">	Defines a one-line text input field
<input type="radio">	Defines a radio button (for selecting one of many choices)
<input type="submit">	Defines a submit button (for submitting the form)
-->

<!-- 
Text Input
<input type="text"> defines a one-line input field for text input:

-->

<!--
    Radio Button Input
<input type="radio"> defines a radio button.

Radio buttons let a user select ONE of a limited number of choices:
 -->
<!-- 
    The Submit Button
<input type="submit"> defines a button for submitting the form data to a form-handler.

The form-handler is typically a server page with a script for processing input data.

The form-handler is specified in the form's action attribute:
-->
<!-- 
    The Action Attribute
The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.

Normally, the form data is sent to a web page on the server when the user clicks on the submit button.

In the example above, the form data is sent to a page on the server called "/action_page.php". This page 
contains a server-side script that handles the form data:
-->
<!-- 
    The Target Attribute
The target attribute specifies if the submitted result will open in a new browser tab, a frame, or in the current window.

The default value is "_self" which means the form will be submitted in the current window.

To make the form result open in a new browser tab, use the value "_blank":
-->
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<form action="/action_page.php">
    First name:<br>
    <input type = "text" name= "Firstname" value="Kagaya">
    <br>
    Last name:<br>
    <input type="text" name="lastname" value="Medel">
    <br>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
<p>If you click the "Submit" button, the form-data will be sent to a page called "/action_page.php".</p>

<form>
    <input type="radio" name="gender" value="male" checked>male<br>
    <input type="radio" name="gender" value="female"> Female<br>
    <input type="radio" name="gender" value="other"> Other

</form>


<p>This form will be submitted using the GET method:</p>

<form action="/action_page.php" target="_blank" method="GET">
  First name:<br>
  <input type="text" name="firstname" value="Mickey">
  <br>
  Last name:<br>
  <input type="text" name="lastname" value="Mouse">
  <br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

<p>After you submit, notice that the form values is visible in the address bar of the new browser tab.</p>
</body>
</html>


<!-- <form action="/action_page.php" method="post">-->
<!-- <form action="/action_page.php" method="get">-->
<!-- 
    When to Use GET?
The default method when submitting form data is GET.

However, when GET is used, the submitted form data will be visible in the page address field:
-->
<!-- 
    Notes on GET:

Appends form-data into the URL in name/value pairs
The length of a URL is limited (about 3000 characters)
Never use GET to send sensitive data! (will be visible in the URL)
Useful for form submissions where a user want to bookmark the result
GET is better for non-secure data, like query strings in Google
-->
<!-- 
    When to Use POST?
Always use POST if the form data contains sensitive or personal information. The POST method does not display the submitted form data in the page address field.

Notes on POST:

POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked
-->
<!-- 
    The Name Attribute
Each input field must have a name attribute to be submitted.

If the name attribute is omitted, the data of that input field will not be sent at all.

This example will only submit the "Last name" input field:
-->
<!--
    Grouping Form Data with <fieldset>
The <fieldset> element is used to group related data in a form.

The <legend> element defines a caption for the <fieldset> element.
 -->
<!--
    Here is the list of <form> attributes:

Attribute	Description
accept-charset	Specifies the charset used in the submitted form (default: the page charset).
action	Specifies an address (url) where to submit the form (default: the submitting page).
