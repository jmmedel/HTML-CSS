    HTML Layout Elements
Websites often display content in multiple columns (like a magazine or newspaper).

HTML5 offers new semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:

HTML5 Semantic Elements	
<header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
<nav> - Defines a container for navigation links
<section> - Defines a section in a document
<article> - Defines an independent self-contained article
<aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
<footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
<details> - Defines additional details
<summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element
HTML Layout Techniques
There are four different ways to create multicolumn layouts. Each way has its pros and cons:

HTML tables
CSS float property
CSS framework
CSS flexbox
 -->
<!-- 
    Which One to Choose?
HTML Tables
The <table> element was not designed to be a layout tool!
     The purpose of the <table> element is to display tabular data.
          So, do not use tables for your page layout! They will bring a
           mess into your code. And imagine how hard it will be to redesign 
           your site after a couple of months.

<!--
    CSS Frameworks
If you want to create your layout fast,
 you can use a framework, like W3.CSS or Bootstrap.

<!-- 
    CSS Flexbox
Flexbox is a new layout mode in CSS3.

Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices. Disadvantages: Does not work in IE10 and earlier.
