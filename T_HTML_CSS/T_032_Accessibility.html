    HTML Accessibility
Write HTML with accessibility in mind. Provide the user 
a good way to navigate and interact with your site. Make your
 HTML code as semantic as possible, so that the code is easy to 
 understand for visitors and screen readers.
-->
<!-- 
    Semantic HTML
Semantic HTML means using correct HTML elements for 
their correct purpose as much as possible. Semantic elements
 are elements with a meaning; if you need a button, use the <button> 
     element (and not a <div>).
-->
<!-- 
    Semantic HTML gives context to screen readers, which read the contents of a web page out loud.

With the button example in mind:

buttons have more suitable styling by default
a screen reader identifies it as a button
focusable
clickable
A button is also accessible for people relying on keyboard-only navigation; it can be clickable with both mouse and keys, and it can be tabbed between (using the tab key on the keyboard).

Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

Headings Are Important
Headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags:
-->

<!-- 
    Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

Users skim your pages by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure and the relationships between different sections.

<h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on.

<!-- 
    Alternative Text
The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot
 view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

The value of the alt attribute should describe the image:
-->
<!-- 
    Declare the Language
Declaring a language is important for screen readers and search engines, 
and is declared with the lang attribute. Use the following to show a web page in English:
-->
<!-- 
    Use Clear Language
Use clear language that is easy to understand, and try to avoid characters that cannot be read clearly by a screen reader. For example:

Keep sentences as short as possible.
Avoid dashes. Instead of writing 1-3, write 1 to 3
Avoid abbreviations. Instead of writing Feb, write February
Avoid slang words

<!-- 
    Link Titles
The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. 
The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element.
