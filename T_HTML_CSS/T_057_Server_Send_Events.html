    Server-Sent Events - One Way Messaging
A server-sent event is when a web page automatically gets updates from a server.

This was also possible before, but the web page would have to ask if any updates were available. With server-sent events, the updates come automatically.

Examples: Facebook/Twitter updates, stock price updates, news feeds, sport results, etc.
-->
<!--Receive Server-Sent Event Notifications
The EventSource object is used to receive server-sent event notifications:
 -->
 <!-- 
     Example explained:

Create a new EventSource object, and specify the URL of the page sending the updates (in this example "demo_sse.php")
Each time an update is received, the onmessage event occurs
When an onmessage event occurs, put the received data into the element with id="result"
 -->
 <!-- 
     Check Server-Sent Events Support
In the tryit example above there were some extra lines of code to check browser support for server-sent events:

if(typeof(EventSource) !== "undefined") {
    // Yes! Server-sent events support!
    // Some code.....
} else {
    // Sorry! No server-sent events support..
}
 -->
 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>Getting server updates</h1>
<div id="result"></div>

<script>
if(typeof(EventSource) !== "undefined") {
    var source = new EventSource("php/demo_sse.php");
    source.onmessage = function(event) {
        document.getElementById("result").innerHTML += event.data + "<br>";
    };
} else {
    document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "Sorry, your browser does not support server-sent events...";
}
</script>

</body>
</html>
<!-- 
    Code explained:

Set the "Content-Type" header to "text/event-stream"
Specify that the page should not cache
Output the data to send (Always start with "data: ")
Flush the output data back to the web page
-->
<!-- 
    The EventSource Object
In the examples above we used the onmessage event to get messages. But other events are also available:

Events	Description
onopen	When a connection to the server is opened
onmessage	When a message is received
onerror	When an error occurs
