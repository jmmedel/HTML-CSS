    HTML Entities
Some characters are reserved in HTML.

If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags.

Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.

A character entity looks like this:

<!--
    Non-breaking Space
A common character entity used in HTML is the non-breaking space: &nbsp;

A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line.

Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together (not break into a new line). This is handy when breaking the words might be disruptive.

Examples:

§ 10
10 km/h
10 PM
Another common use of the non-breaking space is to prevent that browsers truncate spaces in HTML pages.

If you write 10 spaces in your text, the browser will remove 9 of them. To add real spaces to your text, you can use the &nbsp; character entity.

    Combining Diacritical Marks
A diacritical mark is a "glyph" added to a letter.

Some diacritical marks, like grave (  ̀) and acute (  ́) are called accents.

Diacritical marks can appear both above and below a letter, inside a letter, and between two letters.

Diacritical marks can be used in combination with alphanumeric characters, to produce a character that is not present in the character set (encoding) used in the page.

Here are some examples:

Mark	Character	Construct	Result
 ̀	a	a&#768;	à
 ́	a	a&#769;	á
̂	a	a&#770;	â
 ̃	a	a&#771;	ã
 ̀	O	O&#768;	Ò
 ́	O	O&#769;	Ó
̂	O	O&#770;	Ô
 ̃	O	O&#771;	Õ
