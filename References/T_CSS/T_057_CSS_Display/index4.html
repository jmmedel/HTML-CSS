<!--
    visibility:hidden; also hides an element.

However, the element will still take up the same space as before. The element will be hidden, but still affect the layout:

 -->

 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
h1.hidden {
    visibility: hidden;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a visible heading</h1>
<h1 class="hidden">This is a hidden heading</h1>
<p>Notice that the hidden heading still takes up space.</p>

</body>
</html>
