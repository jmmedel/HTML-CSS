    CSS Fonts
    The CSS font properties define the font family, boldness, size, and the style of a text.

Difference Between Serif and Sans-serif Fonts

CSS Font Families
In CSS, there are two types of font family names:

generic family - a group of font families with a similar look (like "Serif" or "Monospace")
font family - a specific font family (like "Times New Roman" or "Arial")
Generic family	Font family	Description
Serif	Times New Roman
Georgia	Serif fonts have small lines at the ends on some characters
Sans-serif	Arial
Verdana	"Sans" means without - these fonts do not have the lines at the ends of characters
Monospace	Courier New
Lucida Console	All monospace characters have the same width
Note: On computer screens, sans-serif fonts are considered easier to read than serif fonts.

Font Family
The font family of a text is set with the font-family property.

The font-family property should hold several font names as a "fallback" system. If the browser does not support the first font, it tries the next font, and so on.

Start with the font you want, and end with a generic family, to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available.

Note: If the name of a font family is more than one word, it must be in quotation marks, like: "Times New Roman".

More than one font family is specified in a comma-separated list:

 -->

 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
p.serif {
    font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
}

p.sansserif {
    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>CSS font-family</h1>
<p class="serif">This is a paragraph, shown in the Times New Roman font.</p>
<p class="sansserif">This is a paragraph, shown in the Arial font.</p>

</body>
</html>
