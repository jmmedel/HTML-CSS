    position: absolute;
An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.

Note: A "positioned" element is one whose position is anything except static.

Here is a simple example:

This <div> element has position: relative; This <div> element has position: absolute;
Here is the CSS that is used:

 -->


 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
div.relative {
    position: relative;
    width: 400px;
    height: 200px;
    border: 3px solid #73AD21;
} 

div.absolute {
    position: absolute;
    top: 80px;
    right: 0;
    width: 200px;
    height: 100px;
    border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>position: absolute;</h2>

<p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed):</p>

<div class="relative">This div element has position: relative;
  <div class="absolute">This div element has position: absolute;</div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
