position: relative;
An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.

Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

This <div> element has position: relative;
Here is the CSS that is used:


-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
div.relative {
    position: relative;
    left: 30px;
    border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>position: relative;</h2>

<div class="relative">
