    Struggling with Video Formats?
Earlier in this tutorial, you have seen that you might have to convert your videos to different formats to make them play in all browsers.

Converting videos to different formats can be difficult and time-consuming.

An easier solution is to let YouTube play the videos in your web page.

YouTube Video Id
YouTube will display an id (like tgbNymZ7vqY), when you save (or play) a video.

You can use this id, and refer to your video in the HTML code.

Playing a YouTube Video in HTML
To play your video on a web page, do the following:

Upload the video to YouTube
Take a note of the video id
Define an <iframe> element in your web page
Let the src attribute point to the video URL
Use the width and height attributes to specify the dimension of the player
Add any other parameters to the URL (see below)
Example - Using iFrame (recommended)
-->
<!-- 
    YouTube Autoplay
You can have your video start playing automatically when a user visits that page by adding a simple parameter to your YouTube URL.

Note: Take careful consideration when deciding to autoplay your videos. Automatically starting a video can annoy your visitor and end up causing more harm than good.

Value 0 (default): The video will not play automatically when the player loads.

Value 1: The video will play automatically when the player loads.
