HTML Images Syntax
In HTML, images are defined with the <img> tag.

The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The src attribute specifies the URL (web address) of the image:

-->

<!-- 
    The alt Attribute
The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

The value of the alt attribute should describe the image:
-->
<!-- 
    Image Size - Width and Height
You can use the style attribute to specify the width and height of an image.
-->
<!--
    Note: Always specify the width and height of an image. If width and height are not specified, the page might flicker while the image loads.
 -->
<!-- 
    Width and Height, or Style?
Both the width, height, and style attributes are valid in HTML5.

However, we suggest using the style attribute. It prevents styles sheets from changing the size of images:
-->
<!--
    Images in Another Folder
If not specified, the browser expects to find the image in the same folder as the web page.

However, it is common to store images in a sub-folder. You must then include the folder name in the src attribute:
 -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <!-- Access to the image file-->
<body style="background-image:url(img/program.png)">
<!-- Access to tthe img file -->
<img  src = "img/program.png" alt="Program" width="500" height="377">

</body>
</html>




<!-- Images on Another Server
Some web sites store their images on image servers.

Actually, you can access images from any web address in the world:-->
<!-- 
    Background Image
To add a background image on an HTML element, use the CSS property background-image:
-->
<!-- 
    The <picture> Element
HTML5 introduced the <picture> element to add more flexibility when specifying image resources.

The <picture> element contains a number of <source> elements, each referring to different image sources. This way the browser can choose the image that best fit the current view and/or device.

Each <source> element have attributes describing when their image is the most suitable.

The browser will use the first <source> element with matching attribute values, and ignore any following <source> elements.
