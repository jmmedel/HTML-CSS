The HTML5 <audio> element specifies a standard way to embed audio in a web page.

    HTML Audio - How It Works
The controls attribute adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume.

The <source> element allows you to specify alternative audio files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <audio> element.

HTML Audio - Methods, Properties, and Events
HTML5 defines DOM methods, properties, and events for the <audio> element.

This allows you to load, play, and pause audios, as well as set duration and volume.

There are also DOM events that can notify you when an audio begins to play, is paused, etc.

For a full DOM reference, go to our HTML5 Audio/Video DOM Reference.
