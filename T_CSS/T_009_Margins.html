    CSS Margins
The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.

With CSS, you have full control over the margins. There are properties for setting the margin for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).
-->
<!-- 
    Margin - Individual Sides
CSS has properties for specifying the margin for each side of an element:

margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom
margin-left
All the margin properties can have the following values:

auto - the browser calculates the margin
length - specifies a margin in px, pt, cm, etc.
% - specifies a margin in % of the width of the containing element
inherit - specifies that the margin should be inherited from the parent element
Tip: Negative values are allowed.

The following example sets different margins for all four sides of a <p> element:
-->
<!-- 
    Margin - Shorthand Property
To shorten the code, it is possible to specify all the margin properties in one property.

The margin property is a shorthand property for the following individual margin properties:

margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom
margin-left
So, here is how it works:

If the margin property has four values:

margin: 25px 50px 75px 100px;
top margin is 25px
right margin is 50px
bottom margin is 75px
left margin is 100px
-->
<!-- 
    If the margin property has three values:

margin: 25px 50px 75px;
top margin is 25px
right and left margins are 50px
bottom margin is 75px
-->
<!-- 
    If the margin property has two values:

margin: 25px 50px;
top and bottom margins are 25px
right and left margins are 50px
-->

<!-- If the margin property has one value:

margin: 25px;
all four margins are 25px
-->
<!-- 
    The auto Value
You can set the margin property to auto to horizontally center the element within its container.

The element will then take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the left and right margins:
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <title>Page Title</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="css/T_009.css" />
    
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Using individual margin properties</h2>

    <div>This div element has a top margin of 100px, a right margin 
        of 150px, a bottom margin of 100px, and a left margin
         of 80px.
    </div>

    <div class="class1">
            This div will be horizontally centered because it has margin: auto;
    </div>

</body>
</html>

<!-- 
    The inherit Value
This example lets the left margin of the <p class="class1"> 
    element be inherited from the parent element (<div>):
-->
<!-- 
    Margin Collapse
Top and bottom margins of elements are sometimes collapsed into a single margin that is equal to the largest of the two margins.

This does not happen on left and right margins! Only top and bottom margins!

Look at the following example:
-->
<!-- 
    In the example above, the <h1> element has a bottom margin of 50px and the <h2> element has a top margin set to 20px.

Common sense would seem to suggest that the vertical margin between the <h1> and the <h2> would be a total of 70px (50px + 20px). But due to margin collapse, the actual margin ends up being 50px.
-->
