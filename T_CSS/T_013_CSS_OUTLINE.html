<!--CSS Outline 
CSS Outline
An outline is a line that is drawn around 
elements, OUTSIDE the borders, to make the element "stand out".
CSS has the following outline properties:

outline-style
outline-color
outline-width
outline-offset
outline
Note: Outline differs from borders! Unlike border, 
the outline is drawn outside the element's border, 
and may overlap other content. Also, the outline is 
NOT a part of the element's dimensions; the element's 
total width and height is not affected by the width of 
the outline.

Outline Style
The outline-style property specifies the style of the outline, and can have one of the following values:

dotted - Defines a dotted outline
dashed - Defines a dashed outline
solid - Defines a solid outline
double - Defines a double outline
groove - Defines a 3D grooved outline
ridge - Defines a 3D ridged outline
inset - Defines a 3D inset outline
outset - Defines a 3D outset outline
none - Defines no outline
hidden - Defines a hidden outline

Note: None of the other outline properties will have any effect, unless the outline-style property is set!

Outline Color
The outline-color property is used to set the color of the outline.

The color can be set by:

name - specify a color name, like "red"
RGB - specify a RGB value, like "rgb(255,0,0)"
Hex - specify a hex value, like "#ff0000"
invert - performs a color inversion (which ensures that the outline is visible, regardless of color background)
The following example shows some different outlines with different colors. Also notice that these elements also have a thin black border inside the outline:
Outline Width
The outline-width property specifies the width of the outline, and can have one of the following values:

thin (typically 1px)
medium (typically 3px)
thick (typically 5px)
A specific size (in px, pt, cm, em, etc)
The following example shows some outlines with different widths:
Outline - Shorthand property
The outline property is a shorthand property for setting the following individual outline properties:

outline-width
outline-style (required)
outline-color
The outline property is specified as one, two, or three values from the list above. The order of the values does not matter.

The following example shows some outlines specified with the shorthand outline property:
Outline Offset
The outline-offset property adds space between an outline and the edge/border of an element. The space between an element and its outline is transparent.

The following example specifies an outline 15px outside the border edge:
