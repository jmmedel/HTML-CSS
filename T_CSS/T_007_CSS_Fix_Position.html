    Background - Shorthand property
To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the background properties in one single property. This is called a shorthand property.

The shorthand property for background is background:

Example
body {
    background: #ffffff url("img_tree.png") no-repeat right top;
}
-->
<!--
    When using the shorthand property the order of the property values is:

background-color
background-image
background-repeat
background-attachment
background-position
It does not matter if one of the property values is missing, as long as the other ones are in this order.
